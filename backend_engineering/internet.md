# Internet

## What is internet and how does it work?
Internet is a decentralised network of networks. Computers share and access information through the backbone of networks,
and data centres store data and host applications and contents.

## IP address
Internet Protocol(IP) address is a number that identifies a computer. Two computers cannot have the same IP address.<br>
IPv6 is the current standard for IP address that forms the unique structure of IP address.

## Packet
Packet is the unit of information transmitted over internet.<br>
It is consisted of 2 parts.
- Header: contains information of source, destination, length and etc.
- Data: contains actual data

## World Wide Web
World Wide Web(WWW) is the application that works on top of internet to provide user-friendly interface,
while supporting hyperlinks, images, videos and many other contents.<br>
And web browsers are used to fetch and retrieve information from web sites to consume contents.

## SSL
Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) is an encrytion technology used on web sites to encrypting transitting data,
hence, only the recipient only knows how to decipher the encryption. 

## DNS
Domain Name System(DNS) is a naming system that translates domain name to IP address.<br>
This system is hierarchical.
1. 1st-level main domain: .com
2. 2nd-level sub domain: google.com
3. 3rd-level sub domain: support.google.com

The top-level domain names can be adminstered by private companies (ex. .com) or government authorities (ex. gov.au).
