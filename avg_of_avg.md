# Average of Averages
An average of average values may be required when aggregating data. There are a number of different average of average methods and they are differ to each other.<br>
Depending on an objective and a nature of data, one may choose one over others.

## Mean of Means
A mean of means only equals to a mean of all when they number of values in aggregate groups are equal. <br>
When there is a skewness in numbers of values from the groups, the mean of means will differ to the mean of all. <br>
ex) Class A has 10 students with grade 60 and class B has 1 student with grade 100. <br>
- The mean of means will result in (60 + 100) / 2 = 80 <br>
- The mean of all will result in (10*60 + 1*100) / 11 = 63 <br>
Likewise, the mean of all will underpresent the student with grade 100. But the mean of means will make the student with grade 100 stand out more.

## Median of Medians
A median of medians only equals to a median of all when the distribution of aggregate groups are equal. <br>
ex) Class A has grades of 10, 10, 20, 80 and class B has grades of 10, 60, 70 ,80, 80. <br>
- The median of medians is median of (45, 45) = 45 <br>
- The median of all is median of (10, 80) = 45 <br>
Likewise, samples from the same distribution will have the median of medians equal to the median of all. 

One approach to make the median of medians close to the median of all is by:
- taking a weighted median where the size of aggregate groups are taken into consideration.
