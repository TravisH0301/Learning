# Data Governance
In modern business, many companies are "data-driven" and data is treated as an "asset". Just as other assets such as cash, houses or jewleries, data needs to be properly managed to build confidence in data and harness benefits from the data asset.

Data governance plays a key role in data management - part of full data lifecycle needs of an organisation, ranging from creation and implementation of architectures to policies and procedures.

Data governance helps to define policies and procedures for maintaining data security and compliance, while ensuring accurate and up-to-date data is available for business objectives.

The data governance can be successfully achieved with processes to implement and scale data governance, people to put data governance in operation and lastly tools to provide capabilities.

### Data Governance Framework






data governance is a continuous, ongoing process.





A holistic approach to data governance involves the creation of a repeatable and scalable data management framework with policies, and standards for the best use of data assets.
