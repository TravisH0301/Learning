In modern business, many companies are "data-driven" and data is treated as an "asset". Just as other assets such as cash, houses or jewleries, data needs to be properly managed to build confidence in data and harness benefits from the data asset.

Data governance plays a key role in data management - part of full data lifecycle needs of an organisation, ranging from creation and implementation of architectures to policies and procedures.

Data governance helps to define policies and procedures for maintaining data security and compliance, while ensuring accurate and up-to-date data is available for business objectives.

How data governance is defined and implemented differ from company to company depending on various factors such as business processes and data management practices. Nonetheless, the data governance can be successfully achieved with processes to implement and scale data governance, people to put in operation and lastly tools to provide capabilities.

### Processes - Data Governance Framework
Data governance framework is a collection of policies and processes for collecting, storing and using data. It is repeatable and scalable to maintain compliance, data quality and transparency over rapidly growing data assets.

In addition to setting out standards, it involes establising metrics to monitor the success of data governance. Some of these metrics may be:
- Data management cost
- Data quality scores
- Reduction in security incidents
- Customer satisfaction levels

### People - Data Stewardship
People are who collaborate to define policies, build processes and operate the data governance within the organisation.
It is important that people at all levels are well-trained and committed to the data governance. This includes defining roles and responsibilities. 

For example, data stewards are the people who ensures data access, security and quality by performing categorisation and classification of data assets.

### Technology
Technology provides capabilities to implement and improve data governance. There are numerous tools in the market that come with many different features, such as, data observability, data catalog and data discovery. 

Having a clear business requirements can help compare the tools. And it is also important to consider if the tools integrate well with the data ecosystem and business processes.
