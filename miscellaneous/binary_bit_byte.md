# Binary, Bit & Byte

## Binary
Binary is a base 2 number system, consists of "0" and "1", which corresponds to "on" and "off" states. These numbers are referred as binary digits.<br>
Computer interprets the binary as an electrical signal. Computers use this electrical signal to process and perform calculation.

There are other base system used in programming. Hexadecimal (base 16) consists of numbers "0"-"9" and letters "A"-"F", where each digit/letter
represents 4 binary digits. Note that computers don't run on hexadecimal.

## Bit
Bit (Binary digIT) is the most granular piece of information that can be stored or manipulated on a computer. It is either "0" or "1".<br>
Bits can be bunched together so the computer uses several bits at the same time. 

## Byte
Byte is the unit of information commonly consists of 8 bits. A byte can represent decimals from "0" to "255". A single byte is roughly equivalent to
a single character.

## Modern architecture
Modern computer architecture typically uses 32-bits or 64-bits (4 bytes or 8 bytes). This means that CPU can process upto 32-bits/64-bits of information
for each clock cycle (operation).

## Character encoding
In order to store characters on computer, characters are encoded into bits/bytes. For example, UTF-8 can encode 1,112,064 character code points\*
using 1 to 4 bytes. Difference character encoding will encode different characters into different binary formats.<br>
\**code point: a numerical value that maps to a character*
